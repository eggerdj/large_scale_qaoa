# Qubit paths

This repository contains the qubit lines on the backends generated by the script `find_best_path.py`.
To identify good qubit paths you must run the scrip `find_best_path.py` for a specified backend and number of qubits.
The paths are then used by the script `large_scale_qaoa.py` that runs QAOA on a IBM Quantum backend.
